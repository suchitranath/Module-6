# EX.No:6(B) Python OOP: Encapsulation with Private Members

## AIM

To implement **Encapsulation** in Python by defining a class `Rectangle` with **private member variables** `__length` and `__breadth`.



## ALGORITHM

1. **Define the Class**:
   - Create a class `Rectangle` with two private attributes: `__length` and `__breadth`.

2. **Initialize Variables**:
   - Use the `__init__()` constructor to set initial values for `__length` and `__breadth`.

3. **Print Values**:
   - Display the private variables from within the class to demonstrate access.

4. **Instantiate the Object**:
   - Create an object of the `Rectangle` class to trigger the constructor.
